## Overview

Hello and Welcome!

The Coding Cheat Sheet’s purpose is to be a digital cheat sheet for all developers to be able to quickly look up tips about various languages and frameworks. Users have the ability to view, like, create and edit tips! This gives the developer community a chance to come together and help one another!

## Motivation

During our time at Flatiron, Pedro and I learned quickly that as a developer, researching problems and solutions is a very common thing! After graduation, we came together and decided to dive into React Native by creating the Coding Cheat Sheet. We believed that it could help give boot campers and developers of all levels another place to look for answers or a quick syntax look up.
